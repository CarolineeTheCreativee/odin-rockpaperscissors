In this project I will be building a rock paper scissors game to showcase everything I have learnt about JavasScript so far from The Odin project JavaScript Fundamentals course as can be seem here: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors. 

This game is aimed to be played entirely from the console so there will be very minimal CSS involved.
